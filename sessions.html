            <h2>Types of Sessions</h2>
            <p>
                SIG meetings will be geared to a particular style of learning:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lab</strong>: The general objective of this type of session is to develop and practice
                    a skills related to using devices through experiential (i.e., "hands on") learning.  The session
                    facilitator will provide exercises and assist others as needed to complete the exercises.
                    Participants need to be able to bring their digital devices with them to these types of sessions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lecture</strong>: The general objective of this type of session is to increase
                    participants' understanding of select/specific digital technologies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Discussion</strong>: The general objective this type of session is to explore how
                    select/specific digital technologies impact/influence culture and society.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In terms of SIG meetings that we schedule during our Spring 2026 term (i.e,. between January 23
                and April 3), the priority will be on Lab and Lecture (with the intention of more Lab and Lecture only
                as needed/desired by the group). In choosing the themes/topics for sessions during the Spring
                2026 term, priority will be on themes/topics covered in the "Tech Skills 101: Driver's Ed for the
                Digital World" course conducted in the Fall 2025 term.
            </p>
            <h2>Structure of Sessions</h2>
            <p>
                <i>TODO: Intend to add some text here that describes how we will structure the time of each meeting.
                   During the Spring 2026 term, Duke OLLI staff have reserved a room for our SIG meetings; we have that
                   room Friday's from 9:00 to noon. I'll attempt to structure sessions so that the planned
                   exercises can be covered/completed in about two hours--giving us an additional hour for possible
                   1:1 assistance with questions/issues members might have that are not directly related to the
                   session's primary theme/topic(s).</i>
            </p>

            <h2>Proposed Sessions</h2>
            <h3>Files</h3>
                <p>
                    This session's primary aim is to increase participants' proficiency accessing and managing files via
                    hands on exercises.  Exercises will encompass standard/typical tasks we do with our devices' file
                    manager apps, apps that allow you to create/save new files and open existing files, and working
                    with files stored locally on your device's disk drive as well as in a cloud drive.
                </p>
            <h3>User Interfaces</h3>
                <p>
                    This session's primary aim is to increase participants' proficiency "reading the screen." We
                    will review common user interface components (e.g., windows, menus, toolbars, controls, etc.).
                    Exercises will be designed to give you the opportunity to practice identifying user interface
                    components on your screen, understanding what the controls do, as well as using them.
                </p>
            <h3>Browsers</h3>
                <p><i>
                    Browsers are an important kind of app when it comes using the Internet; it is hard for me to
                    imagine that everyone doesn't use a browser at times. And while all browsers have the same primary
                    purpose (i.e., to visit/view content found on websites on the Internet), they also have common
                    "convenience" features, security features, and privacy features.  In this session we will review
                    what these common features are and do some exercises to familiarize ourselves with how to use them.
                </i></p>
            <h2>Safety: Cybersecurity</h2>
                <p>
                    In the Fall 2026 "Tech Skills 101: Tech Skills 101: Driver's Ed for the Digital World" course, we
                    had two sessions on this topic.  The primary objective of this SIG meeting are to practice via
                    lab exercises skills associated with securing our accounts and data. This could include using a
                    password manager, creating strong passwords, using an authenticator app for two factor
                    authentication, and using Apple's advanced cloud security features.
                </p>
            <h3>Settings</h3>
                <p>
                    Settings are an important kind of software feature; they allow you to control/customize how
                    your device and/or your apps. In my experience, it's fairly common for the cause and/or solution
                    to problems we have with our devices to be related--in part if not entirely--to a system or app
                    setting.
                <p>
                    In this session, we will review the myriad available settings and learn how to differentiate between
                    system settings and app settings.
                </p>
            <h2>Safety: Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    This was an "optional"/"time permitting" topic in the "Tech Skills 101: Driver's Ed for the Digital
                    World" course held during the Fall 2025 term; we were not able to cover this topic during the
                    course due to time constraints.  If members of the SIG are interested, we can add this topic to
                    the SIG schedule.
                </p>
            <h3>Navigating the Internet</h3>
                <p>
                    This was an "optional"/"time permitting" topic in the "Tech Skills 101: Driver's Ed for the Digital
                    World" course held during the Fall 2025 term; we were not able to cover this topic during the
                    course due to time constraints.  If members of the SIG are interested, we can add this topic to
                    the SIG schedule.
                </p>
            <h3>Safety: Well-Being</h3>
                <p>
                    This was an "optional"/"time permitting" topic in the "Tech Skills 101: Driver's Ed for the Digital
                    World" course held during the Fall 2025 term; we were not able to cover this topic during the
                    course due to time constraints.  If members of the SIG are interested, we can add this topic to
                    the SIG schedule.
                </p>
            <h3>The Manual</h3>
                <p>
                    Participants in the "Tech Skills 101: Driver's Ed for the Digital World" course held during the
                    Fall 2025 term expressed a lot of interest in having a single reference (i.e., a book) they could
                    turn to when they needed assistance using their devices.  Unfortunately, there is no single book
                    that explains everything we can do with our devices.  Instead there are many books, and finding
                    the best book(s) for you can be challenging (for a variety of reasons).  Regardless, the passion
                    of folks interest in this kind of reference prompted me to spend time thinking about how "computer
                    geeks" tend to address this kind of need and I think there are some strategies/methods used by
                    "computer geeks" that anyone could learn/practice that fill this need.
                </p>
            <h3>Email</h3>
                <p>
                    Email is a key feature of the Internet; everyone uses email.  While we briefly touch on email in
                    some session in the Fall 2026 "Tech Skills 101" course, we didn't have a focused discussion on much
                    less any kind of "deep dive."  It may be useful/worthwhile to schedule a SIG meeting on email.
                    Possible topics we could cover in such a session:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How to manage spam email</li>
                    <li>How to manage the storage space consumed by your email service</li>
                    <li>How to identify/recognize scam email</li>
                    <li>How to use an email app to manage your email (instead of using your browser)</li>
                </ol>
